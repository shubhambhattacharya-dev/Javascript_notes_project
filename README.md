# Javascript_notes_project
JavaScript (JS) is a widely used programming language for creating dynamic web content. It works with HTML and CSS and supports both client-side and server-side development (e.g., with Node.js). Key uses include form validation, animations, and updating content without page reloads

# How JavaScript Code Runs or Executes

Step 1: Writing the Code

              -The process begins with the code file where we write our JavaScript code.

               -The first task is parsing.

# What is Parsing?

                -Parsing is a mechanism performed by every programming language.

                -It involves collecting the keywords and syntax written in the code to determine what actions need to be performed.

# Step 2: Syntax Tree Check

                -After parsing, the code is checked for proper structure.

                -This step ensures that the code is written in a valid format and adheres to JavaScript syntax rules.

 # All of this happens before the code is executed.

                 -The Role of the JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time Compiler)

                 -The JIT compiler acts as an intermediary between bytecode and machine code.

                 -It functions as an interpreter that optimizes and speeds up code execution.

 #  Step 1: Conversion to Bytecode

                    -After passing through the JIT compiler, the code is converted to bytecode.

                    -Bytecode is not machine code but an intermediate representation that bridges the gap between the source code and machine code.

                     -This step enhances the speed of code execution.

# Step 2: Conversion to Machine Code

                      -The bytecode is then translated into machine code (0s and 1s), which the computer can understand and execute.

# Step 3: Code Execution

Finally, the machine code is executed, and the desired operations are performed.
