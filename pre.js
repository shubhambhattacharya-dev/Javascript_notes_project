//primitive data type
 
                                                           //number
let balance = 120;//this is number
// a method that help to know what type its =typeof()
console.log(typeof(balance)); // datatype-number
console.log(balance); // datatype-number
//another way: for - complex data type,non-primitive data type

let anotherBalance= new Number(120);
console.log(anotherBalance);// value with data type and its an object
// for only value use - valueof()  method;
console.log(anotherBalance.valueOf());// its gives only value 

// now is the main question what is the main difference of balance and anotherBalance :
// balance is - number (datatype)
//anotherBalance is - object (non primitive datatype)
 console.log(typeof(anotherBalance));// see its an object\

 //every single primitive can also be coverted into non-primitive
 // every thing in js is an object
                                                     //boolean
